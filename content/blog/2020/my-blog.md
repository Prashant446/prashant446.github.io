After years of procrastinating I finally made my personal website, thanks to this boring pandemic life. One of the most important things for 
me was to build it from scratch with minimal use of frameworks. I wrote almost all of css and js myself and once again realized how much of 
a pain frontend development is. I ended up using hugo for static site generation and it's amazing! I write posts in markdown and hugo uses 
my predefined templates to convert them into html and organize them appropriately. It saves you from reduntant work, is highly flexible and 
has tons of other features too.

## Current Details
* Static, written in HTML, CSS, and JS
* **Dark mode**: Well, I am a fan
  * credits: [Yes, I copy code too](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56550819/10154017)
* Categories, thanks to hugo!
* Fonts
  * Headings: *Raleway*
  * General: *Roboto*

At this point just wanna say...

## To-dos
* Add cool dark mode transition (guess I overestimated myself)
* Tags: easy to implement but no need as of now
