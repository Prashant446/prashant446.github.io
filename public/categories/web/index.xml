      <description>After years of procrastinating I finally made my personal website, thanks to this boring pandemic life. One of the most important things for me was to build it from scratch with minimal use of frameworks. I wrote almost all of css and js myself and once again realized how much of a pain frontend development is. I ended up using hugo for static site generation and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing! I write posts in markdown and hugo uses my predefined templates to convert them into html and organize them appropriately.</description>
